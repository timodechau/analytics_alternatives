## Use cases 

#### Server-side tracking 

Description:
You can use the different Snowplow SDKs to send data from your backend systems directly into the event pipeline. Same for Webhook data where Snowplow offers some out of the box tracking. 

#### Schema based events 

Description:
you need to define schemas for each event and custom context you are tracking. Data that does not match the schema is still received but ends up on an intermediate pipeline where you can decide how to process it. 

#### Marketing attribution 

Description:
Snowplow does not offer an out of box attribution solution. But with the extensive data you collect with Snowplow you can develop your own attribution models in your data warehouse. 

#### Product analytics 

Description:
Snowplow does not offer any of the specific product analytics reports like Amplitude or Mixpanel does (funnels, cohorts,..). But the raw data allows you to create these yourself based on individual calculations.
